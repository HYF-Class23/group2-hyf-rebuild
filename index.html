              We believe in a world in which education and quality jobs are
              accessible for all. This is why we have designed a free 34 week
              program for refugees and newcomers.

              After the program we support our students in finding high quality
              jobs. Our success criteria is not graduation from the course but
              employment in the tech industry.
